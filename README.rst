The `datetime2 <http://pypi.org/project/datetime2>`_ module provides similar
features to those given by the standard
`datetime <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html>`_ module,
adding the capability of constructing and representing date and time in many
formats. Additionally, it removes a few limits that the original package has.

*datetime2* is a one-man, free-time work.

Planned releases
================

* 0.9: Implementation of TimeDelta, which currently is a stub
* 1.0: Implementation of DateTime, first production release
* 1.1: Implementation of Julian and Hebrew calendars

Project objectives
==================

* Decoupling between operations on date and time objects and their
  representation.
* Access to different calendars, for input parsing and output formatting.
* Access to different time representations, also for input and output.
* Infinite precision in converting between different time representations.
* Ability to dynamically register new formatting classes.
* Internationalization.
* Implementation of the part of the Unicode Locale Database concerned with
  dates and times.
* Interface with other Python modules or inclusion of their
  functionalities in submodules.

These objectives are very long term ones, which I am setting because I think it is
important to establish a direction for the project.

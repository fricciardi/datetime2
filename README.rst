datetime2
=========

The *datetime2* module provides date
and time classes to Python. It will enhance the standard
`datetime <http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/datetime.html>`_ module, adding the capability
of constructing and representing date and time in many formats
and removing a few limits that the original package has.

*datetime2* is a one-man, free-time work. Although
I am deeply committed in completing the project, do not expect regular updates on it.

If you are looking for more information, check the following:

* `datetime2 PyPI pages <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/datetime2>`_, where versions are uploaded;

  information on development and documentation.

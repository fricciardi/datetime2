datetime2
=========

The `datetime2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/datetime2>`_ module provides date
and time classes to Python, like the standard
`datetime <http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/datetime.html>`_ module.

However, the `datetime2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/datetime2>`_ module is
not restricted to the gregorian calendar, and allows also to represent time
with fancier methods than the usual hour, minutes, second way.

You can have a look at the `wiki <https://github.com/fricciardi/datetime2/wiki>`_
for further information on development and documentation.

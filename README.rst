datetime2
=========

Datetime2 provides new classes for date and times in Python.

This module will provide date and time classes, as the original 
`datetime <http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/datetime.html>`_ module does.
These classes on the one hand separate date and time handling from their
representation, on the other hand they will provide new calendars and time
measurement systems. 

Current development stage is *planning*. Until first release, I will follow a
"document-write tests-write" code cycle.

Stay tuned for the first pre-alpha version.

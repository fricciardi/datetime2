datetime2
=========

The `datetime2 <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/datetime2>`_ module
provides new classes date and time classes.

This module will provide date and time classes, as the original 
`datetime <http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/datetime.html>`_ module does.
The new classes on the one hand will separate date and time handling from
their representation, on the other hand they will provide new calendars and
time measurement systems.

Code is hosted at `GitHub <http://github.com/fricciardi/datetime2>`_: see
that page for development information.

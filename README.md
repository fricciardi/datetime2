The *datetime2* module provides date and time classes to Python. It will enhance the 
standard [datetime](http://docs.python.org/py3k/library/datetime.html) module, 
adding the capability of constructing and representing date and time in many formats
and removing a few limits that the original package has.

*datetime2* is a one-man, free-time work. Although
I am deeply committed in completing the project, do not expect regular updates on it.

If you are looking for more information, check the following:

* [datetime2 PyPI page](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/datetime2), where versions are 
  uploaded;

* [wiki pages](https://github.com/fricciardi/datetime2/wiki), for further
  information on development and documentation.
  
Please note that Python 2.x is not supproted because it does not have keyword only arguments,
which instead are used in a few functions and methods.
